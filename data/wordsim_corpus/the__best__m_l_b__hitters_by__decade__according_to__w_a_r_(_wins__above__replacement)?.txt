The Best MLB Hitters by Decade According to WAR (Wins Above Replacement)?

Baseball has seen a different hitting star every decade

Baseball is an ever-evolving sport. As the years go by, stars fade in and out of notoriety and the envelope of skill and ability are constantly being pushed. Hitting a baseball may well be the single toughest thing to do in sports. The greatest hitters will only succeed about three times out of ten. Who have been the best hitters through the decades? WAR (Wins Above Replacement) is one statistic that measures effectiveness against a replacement-level substitute. By that metric (offense only- oWAR), here are the best hitters from each decade since 1900.

1900s- Honus Wagner, 80.8 oWAR: The bow-legged shortstop is still remembered as one of the greatest players to ever play the game. It can’t be understated how much he dominated the 1900s, during which time he batted a combined .352 with 51 home runs, 956 RBIs and 487 stolen bases. His oWAR is more than 40% greater than runner-up Nap Lajoie, who was no slouch himself ,yet lags well behind with 57.4.

1910s- Ty Cobb, 84.4 oWAR: There should be no surprise here since Cobb was the best hitter of the Deadball Era, unless it’s wondering how his total isn’t even higher. Playing for the Detroit Tigers, he tore through the 1910s, hitting .387 with 1,948 base hits, 161 triples, 47 home runs, 827 RBIs and 576 stolen bases. He simply played in a different gear than everyone else. Fellow outfielder, Tris Speaker, came in second in the decade with an oWAR of 69.2.

1920s- Babe Ruth, 95.7 oWAR: This should come as no surprise to anyone who has even a passing knowledge of baseball history. The Bambino transformed the sport from a pitching and defensive-centric game into one filled with offensive explosion. In the 1920s, starring for the New York Yankees, he combined to hit .355 with 467 home runs, 1,338 RBIs, 1,365 runs scored and 1,240 walks. He was so great, he outpaced Rogers Hornsby, who was second with an amazing 91.3 mark of his own.

1930s- Lou Gehrig, 77.0 oWAR: How amazing is it that Gehrig and Ruth’s careers overlapped as teammates for a decade? Larrupin’ Lou was a force to be reckoned with but often had to play second banana because of his more famous running mate. In the 1930s, he hit .343 with 347 home runs, 1,360 RBIs, 1,257 runs score and 1,028 walks. He easily bested Jimmie Foxx, who came in second at 69.7.

1940s- Ted Williams, 64.4 oWAR: This number is even more impressive considering that the Boston Red Sox legend missed three full seasons in the 1940s due to military service. In the seasons in which he played, he hit .356 with 234 home runs, 893 RBIs and 994 walks. Runner-up Stan Musial (55.0) missed two seasons and all but 12 games of a third himself.

1950s- Mickey Mantle, 65.9 oWAR: Taking over center field for the Yankees to replace the irreplaceable Joe DiMaggio, Mantle combined to hit .311 with 280 home runs and 841 RBIs. He didn’t debut until 1951 and in his rookie year only played a partial season. Musial, at 61.4, was a bridesmaid for a second consecutive decade.

1960s- Hank Aaron, 71.1 oWAR: In the closest of the WAR battles, Aaron edged out fellow outfielder Willie Mays (71.0) by a tenth of a point to claim the highest oWAR of the decade. Remarkably durable, he played in 1,540 games, hitting .308 with 375 home runs, 1,107 RBIs, while scoring 1,091 runs for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves.

1970s- Joe Morgan, 66.1 oWAR: The Hall-of-Fame second baseman could do everything on offense (and defense as well). In the 1970s, he hit .282 with 173 home runs, 1,071 RBIs, 1,005 runs and 488 stolen bases. Rod Carew, who had the next highest mark (56.5), was a better hitter but had little power and didn’t run nearly as often.

1980s- Rickey Henderson, 59.2 oWAR: Cut from a similar cloth as Morgan, Henderson was not only multi-dimensional but also the greatest leadoff hitter the game has ever seen. For the decade, he hit .291 with 137 homers, 535 RBIs, 962 walks, 1,122 runs and a whopping 838 stolen bases. Perhaps in a mild surprise, the decade runner up was Milwaukee Brewers’ Robin Yount at 56.9.

1990s- Barry Bonds, 68.4 oWAR: Bonds came into his stardom during the 1990s, combining for a .302 batting average, 361 home runs, 1,076 RBIs, 343 steals, 1,091 runs and 1,146 walks. Ken Griffey Jr. got a lot more attention at the time, but was quite a ways back in the second spot at 61.2.

2000s- Alex Rodriguez, 76.5 oWAR: The infielder was frequently maligned because of his massive contracts but he did back it up with tremendous production. For the decade, he batted .304 with 435 home runs, 1,243 RBIs, 1,190 runs and 179 steals. Runner up Albert Pujols (63.5) didn’t debut until 2001 and didn’t have nearly the same impact in the running department (60 steals) as A-Rod.

2010s- Mike Trout, 71.4 oWAR: Trout is the player whose excellence on the field revolutionized the use of the WAR statistic. Although he debuted in 2011, he hit .305 with 285 home runs, 752 RBIs and 200 steals in just 1,199 games. He won three MVP awards but could have easily won several more if the WAR stat was embraced more by voters. Despite being such a consistent player during his career, it may surprise some that second baseman Robinson Cano is second in the 2010s with a 50.4 oWAR.
