A few days into Spring and the backyard

is wild with light, bursting with beginnings

before I catch my reflection in the window.

The hard yards of recent weeks are on my face

and the seduction of safety have starved my eyes.

Then, an impression no louder than the loyalty of my breath

sweeps through my mind:

You have built a life containing spiritually mediocre days

filled with fear, hurry, and anxiety.

But this new story has been quietly forming,

waiting for you until you were ready to emerge.

Take this invitation and

Let your words be sharp as a sword,

let your heart be full of understanding,

let your hands be fit for excellence,

let your eyes be filled with clarity,

let your feet walk with endurance,

let your mind be fluid like water,

let your thoughts be brave with risk,

let your life be generous with love.

I step outside into the backyard and a blue jay lands

on a budding yellow rose and I am thrown

onto a new, unfamiliar shore.
