As the spread of Covid-19 across the world and across the UK became more and more concerning, the likelihood of us having the wedding we’d planned looked less and less promising.

We made contingency plan after contingency plan; we’d still get married, and hold the reception later. We’d do a tiny ceremony with just our parents, become husband and wife — that was the important bit, right?

But when we found out that the newest requirements meant, if we still wanted to marry, we could have only 2 witnesses, and that hugging and touching was pretty much against the rules, (other than the bride and groom, of course) we felt there was no option other than to postpone the entire thing.

The idea of having an empty church was sad enough, but not being able to have all 4 parents to witness our marriage — that was just non-negotiable.

The wedding we were being offered looked far too different to the one we’d always imagined. And it was heartbreaking.
