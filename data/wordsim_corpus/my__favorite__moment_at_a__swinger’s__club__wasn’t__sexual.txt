The woman stood in the bathroom, tilting her head to the side and examining her reflection. Her glossy brown hair flowed to her shoulders, left bare by the spaghetti straps of her zebra-print dress. She’d walked into the club in jeans and a sweater and was changing in the restroom as many swinger-ladies do — it’s hard to explain a fishnet body stocking to a babysitter.

“You look great,” I smiled at her.

“Uh, thanks. I’m not sure whether to leave my jeans on under the dress or take them off. It’s pretty short.”

“Isn’t that the point? This is a swinger’s club. No one is going to tell you your skirt is too short,” I pointed out.

“That’s easy for you to say, you’re a tiny person. I’ve had three kids, and my body is not at all like yours.”

I considered her statement for a moment. I’m currently a size four and have maintained that for a few years, but I’ve been every size between two and 14. After my most recent child was born, the meds I was on for postpartum depression only made me gain more weight. I had been where this woman was — evaluating the size of my hips or midsection and comparing it to smaller women everywhere.

I did something I never thought I would.

I lifted the hem of my blue minidress and showed this woman the stretch marks from my first pregnancy. Like 8 out of 10 women who go through pregnancy, I have tiger stripes from navel to mid-thigh. The universe thinks it is funny to give women who are 5'2" ten-pound babies.

“Wear the dress, lose the jeans. You look hot,” I dropped my dress and walked into the stall.
