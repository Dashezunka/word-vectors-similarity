Author and spiritual educator Carolyn Myss describes the saboteur archetype as that which, “helps you learn the many ways in which you undermine yourself.”

The sundry ways in which we prevent ourselves from dropping into our power and actualizing what we desire is largely rooted in how the inner saboteur interferes with engaging with vulnerability. To dismantle this trend we are challenged to define what we are afraid to feel and confront.

By knowing what is feared we can relate to the saboteur in a constructive way and work towards curtailing the impulse to avoid while encouraging the impulse to meet that which is feared. This requires a willingness to connect to our vulnerability.

Recalling an example from my personal history takes me back to my formative years when I was a selective mute. Systemic traumas in my family of origin catapulted me into shock and hampered socialization. Hence, finding my voice was fraught with complex difficulties.

An inviolate part of me wanted to speak publicly from a deeply impactful and meaningful place. Acting offered me that platform, albeit I was horribly stage fright.

The pull of hope and the push of despair inspired me to face my vulnerability with performance. Although I was scared of the possible humiliation and being a failure, I was more afraid of being silent and creatively barren.

My struggles with performance and public speaking spanned decades of work that involved grassroots theater, acting classes, and podcasts. I even developed a therapeutic theatre event for at-risk women and girls. Each hurdle was mired in anxiety and vulnerability, to the point where I sometimes felt it was too lofty and too emotionally depleting to persevere with these endeavors. Periodically stepping back and recalibrating in the sterility and comfort of safety was critical with my staying the course.
