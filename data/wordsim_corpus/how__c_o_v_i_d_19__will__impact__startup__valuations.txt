Last week, I shared some opinions on whatâ€™s going to happen to the startup market over the next few quarters. But this week, I thought Iâ€™d get some data instead of just speculating (breaking all sorts of VC rules).

Here are some observations on what will happen to venture deals over the next few quarters by looking at VC-backed deals before and after the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2008 global financial crisis.

Early Stage Deals and Valuations

The charts above show the number of Seed and Series A deals (blue bars), as well as their median post-money valuations (red lines), in the years before and after the 2000 and 2008 stock market crashes. The top row shows the 2000 dot-com crash, and the bottom row shows the 2008 financial crisis.

Maybe unsurprisingly, the dot-com crash had a much more significant impact on startup fundraising than the global financial crisis. For example, the number of seed deals increased in both 2009 and 2010, and Series A valuations did not decrease significantly post-2008.

Otherwise, it looks like historically, there has been a 25â€“30% drop in the number of early-stage deals after an economic downtown, and median valuations decrease 10â€“20% per year for several years post-crisis.

ðŸš€ Later Stage Deals and Valuations

Later stage startups are more sensitive to the public markets because investors use public companies as comparables to set valuations, and thatâ€™s reflected in the historical data for Series C and D rounds.

In 2001, the median valuation for later-stage rounds dropped 50%, and it continued dropping over 20% in 2002. The number of later-stage deals also dropped by 20â€“40% (seems like a 30% decline in a deal count is a magic number for some reason).

The 2008 crash had a smaller impact on Series C and D deals. There was still a 25% decline in median valuations in the following year, but valuations recovered within two years to pre-crisis levels, likely driven by a broader market recovery.
