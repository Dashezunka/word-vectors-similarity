Delicate feelings from our hearts

Must precious ones we ever have,

Kindness filled, genuine and true

No deceptions or manipulations,

But nurture for our mortal spirits.

Often occurring in silent moments

When allowed the space to surface

During contemplative meditations,

Looking within self introspectively

Without distractive crashing waves.

Reflecting on what is loveâ€™s nature?

Our gentle love and its inner warmth

For special people in our lives,

Love for common humanity too

Other valued beings, same as us.

Heartful feelings, spiritual presence,

Part of nurturing our human condition

And defining us for who we are,

Precious feelings from our hearts.
