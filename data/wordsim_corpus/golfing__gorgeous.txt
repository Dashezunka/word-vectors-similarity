Golfing Gorgeous

Fiction Friday

I peek as George takes a swing at the golf range.

The ball goes soaring.

And when George turns, we accidentally lock eyes.

George: Diane?

My face grows red.

George: I didn’t know you golfed!

I don’t. But he can’t know that.

I’ve crushed on him at work all year.

And…I’ve been spying as he plays.

Me: Now and then.

George: For how long?

Me: Oh. It’s been…Years.

I last played in middle school.

But George looks so excited to see me.

George: Care to join?

I hide my hands behind my back.

Me: I’m no expert or anything.

My heart’s pounding in my chest.

And I feel butterflies in my stomach.

Me: I’d hate to interrupt.

George: You’re right handed, right?

I nod.

George: Here. Use my club.

I grab ahold of his club.

It’s heavier than I remember.

And I get a whiff of his spicy cologne.

I set-up my swing. Or try to, anyway.

And I focus on that tiny golf ball.

Obviously, I miss.

Me: Oops.

I try again.

And I miss again, stamping my foot.

George: Need help?

Me: I may be beyond help.

George: Nobody’s beyond help.

George gets behind me.

We’ve never been this close.

His arms wrap around me, stretching for the club.

He grips my hands over it.

And his voice is a soft whisper.

George: Hold it like this.

I whisper back with a sigh.

Me: Okay.

George: And stand wider.

I widen my stance.

Me: Like that?

George: Perfect.

I like this closeness.

I can feel his breath at my neck.

Me: Now what?

George: Swing. And graze the ground. Okay?

Me: Okay.

George: And follow through like this.

He moves my arms up for a swing…

And sends them down in a practice swing.

The touch of his fingertips is electrifying.

It sends trembles down my legs.

Me: I’ll try.

George steps back.

And I stare at the ball with determination.

That’s it. I’ll hit this for George.

And so I swing like he showed me.

The ball bounces forward onto the grass.

Me: I did it!

I jump with glee until I spot George, grinning.

I instantly blush.

George: You’re a regular Tiger Woods.

Me: I get that a lot.

George: I’m gonna take a wild guess…You’re no golfer, are you?

Me: Not remotely. It’s my first time in years.

George: I can tell. But why’d you come here?

I bite my lips in hesitation.

I spied on him from the farmer’s market?

He’ll think I stalked him.

George: I didn’t realize it was so complicated.

Me: Honestly, I was next door and saw you drive in.

My cheeks burn.

Me: I wanted to watch.

George plunges his hands in his pockets.

I think he’s blushing too.

Me: But not in a weird way! I thought it’d be cool.

George: I’m flattered, but I’m no expert.

Me: You’re better than me.

George: We both know that’s no compliment.

I laugh and George smiles.

George: But you learn quickly. I can teach more…if you want.

He wants me to stay!?

Me: Of course.

This is our chance to get close.

But George bites his lip, like he was just being polite.

Me: You don’t *have* to help me. I’ll go.

George fidgets.

George: Diane, if I seem nervous, it’s because I’ve really wanted to get to know you. But I’d try talking at work and stop myself in embarrassment.

Me: Of me?

George: I’m not a big people-person. I tend to keep to myself. Even the thought of…asking you on a date…just made me panic.

Me: I’m the same way!

I stare in his green eyes.

Me: I tell you what, George. You teach me to golf…And I’ll teach you to date.

I let a sultry pause hang in the air.

George: You’ve got a deal.

We hold our gaze, flames traveling back and forth.

And finally we lunge for each other.

The golf club drops to our side, and we kiss, passionately.

George: Much better than your swing.

Me: We’ll work on that.
