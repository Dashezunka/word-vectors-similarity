With the COVID-19 situation occurring worldwide, many are focusing on keeping locked down and safe inside. The last thing you may think of is anything around traveling, especially specifically, space travel.

However, for the last few years, space tech has made huge advancements.

From sending 3D printers to the International Space Station to more innovative approaches to satellite communication, we’ve made advancements into space tech more than ever before.

Arguably leading this charge has been the involvement of venture capital funds within the industry.

SpaceX is an example of a company that proved (although Elon did a lot his own money initially) you don’t need to be NASA or a government space body to not only successfully commercialize space aircraft but make them reusable through external funding.

This has raised awareness for many newer space tech startups, especially increasing their access to capital which otherwise, would have never allowed some of their innovation to ever exist in the first place.

Let’s take a look at some of these startups.
