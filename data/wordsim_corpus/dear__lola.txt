When I asked Lola about her childhood

she smiled while reliving poverty.

War was quiet marches through the jungle forest,

what is identity when you are hungry?

Water was life, water was weapon

weaponized against her family, she says

as she sips tea.

They won, or we won for them,

or our colonizers defeated the other colonizers.

She made it here, somehow. Love or

grit, or sheer will â€” not by chance.
