Anal sex is like waking up early. People either love it or they really, really hate it. Personally, I fall into the latter camp, but lately, I’ve been wondering … is there ever a time when you should reconsider anal sex?

Let’s say you once found yourself involved with a selfish and demanding partner who considered anal sex a required part of your lovemaking routine, and you hated it. Maybe he was too rough. Maybe he didn’t believe in foreplay or finesse. No matter what the problem, there was indeed a problem, and because of that, you can’t possibly imagine ever going down that particular back road again.

Then one day, years later, you meet someone new, someone kinder and more attentive, someone who makes you want to give it your all — and by “it,” I mean sex. After trying all the usual sex acts, the topic of anal sex rears its ugly head, and that’s when you realize that just maybe the topic of anal sex isn’t so ugly after all.

What changed? It was the circumstances.

While no one is suggesting that you should revisit anal sex if you have had a bad experience or you are otherwise opposed to it, there is something to be said for having the right to change your mind if you want to. What’s important is understanding that you have the right to change your mind, and the right to stand firm in your opinion on anal sex, in equal measure.
