Who Owns Your Sexy Photos?

How attitudes around revenge porn reveal that feminism still has a long battle ahead.

I’ve been on Medium for almost a year now and I’ve been surprised to find that one of my most-read pieces of writing is a comment I left on an article about revenge porn that I posted in December 2019.

The article described a woman’s experience in which nude photographs that had been taken by a friend were stolen, years later, by another friend — a man — who then posted them online without her consent. For a variety of reasons, she was not able to take legal action against her “friend” and the photos remained on the internet until the platform on which he posted them closed. Though, as she emphasized, that didn’t mean the photos were gone.

“Of course the pictures aren’t gone. They’re still out there, somewhere, distributed innumerably. They could come back at any time. This will never not have happened.”

I was so disgusted by what had happened and by how often this happens to women that I left the following comment:

“Years from now, this WILL be treated like the crime that it is. It’s going to be a helluva journey to get there (which should NOT be the case) but we WILL get there.”

Incredibly, I have received more hate mail from this comment than I have from any actual article I have written. This includes a comment that I call “death-threat adjacent.” It also earned me my first stalker troll — someone who didn’t like that I blocked him on Medium and who then found me on Instagram to continue harassing me.

Why?

Because apparently there are some men in this world who are convinced that when a woman has a nude photograph taken, she gives up all rights to the image and her privacy.
