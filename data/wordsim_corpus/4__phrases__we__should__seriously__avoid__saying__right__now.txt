The other day a friend sent me a video from The New York Times entitled “Health Care Kamikazes: How Spain’s Workers Are Battling Coronavirus Unprotected.”

The video was super well done — it’s The New York Times after all. But the title? Really? A team of editors and writers from one of the world’s finest institutions agreed “Kamikazes” was the best word to describe a group of people who are willingly putting themselves at risk to not only save lives but to make sure people do not die alone.

Like everyone here in Spain has been seriously affected by this damn virus.

A close friend of my father-in-law passed away this week. My neighbor’s mother is in critical condition. A tear ran down his face when he told me how painful it is not to be able to visit her. The father of my wife’s best friend, one of the “Kamikaze” doctors, passed away this morning. Her brother and mother also have the virus.

As of today, over 15,000 medical workers in Spain have contracted COVID-19. Despite having a smaller population than China, Italy, and The United States, this is the highest number of confirmed cases in the world for hospital workers.

Put yourself in the shoes of the workers who have contracted the virus. Put yourself in the shoes of those who are still working every day. Put yourself in the shoes of their worried families and friends.

Surely there has to be a better word than “Kamikazes” to describe these people who are working around the clock with a serious lack of resources to care for our loved ones. A kinder word.

I don’t have a New York Times worthy vocabulary. But some examples that immediately come to mind are “courageous” “brave” or what people here in Spain prefer to call them — “heroes.”

Unfortunately, “Kamikazes” isn’t the only example I’ve been seeing that has left people steaming. Below are a few more phrases people going through an extremely challenging time don’t want to hear right now.
