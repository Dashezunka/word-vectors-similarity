I took the bait, hook, line and sinker

and got so tangled up in you

I forgot that you can’t be my lifeline now

no matter what we do.

Loving alone in this dangerous time

so close that it hurts

so far gone in a paralyzed lie.

Still, each night about seven

you take a byte from my heart

and I melt into your pixelated eyes.

For an hour or two

tethered to each other’s laughter

puppets tugs each other’s heartstrings

and fake their happily ever after.
