Dance of The Fearless

A sonnet about fearlessness

The fighter stands alone in the ring;

Cocky strut and powerful voice within:

“No fear can we have, we who would be king”

We demand ‘no quarter’ as the battle begins.

The dancer twirls in the light of the stage;

Fearless physique twisting in perfect control;

Vaulting free, an animal sprung from the cage,

And vivacious we dance with spirit so bold.

We circle, dancing, confident we cannot be caught;

We twist and leap sure that our body will hold.

With lion hearted courage our glory is sought,

Yet even the best and bravest must fall.

But fearless lives not in our victorious tries,

It’s in the grace of our falls, and in how hard we rise.
