She drags her fingers down her arm, touches her stomach, slides them through the curve of her waist. In her mind, it’s still his fingers stroking her body.

His touch lingers on her skin.

His smell, printed in the bedsheets, it’s intoxicating. She breathes it in, holding it, tattooing the memory in her lungs.

With her eyes closed — as if, opening them, the memories would flee — she replayed their passionate night in her mind.

Their chemistry bound their bodies; their hunger fed each other.

He left an empty space in the bed. He left an unbearable craving on her.

She is now made of happy memories and loss.

Which ones will hurt her the less?
