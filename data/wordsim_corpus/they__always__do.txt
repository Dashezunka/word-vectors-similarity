I have burned every bridge

I’ve ever touched

holding hands

lingering in suspension

affixed to boards with nails

my back arching, aching

to feel a love

I’ve never known.

Destruction

is the only way I know

to end —

since I never mend

I keep pushing

until it breaks

under my weight

the bags I carry

under my eyes

around my waste

between my thighs

so you won’t remember

how it felt

to touch me.

When I tell you to stay

away and never

come back, I know

you’ll listen.

They always do.
