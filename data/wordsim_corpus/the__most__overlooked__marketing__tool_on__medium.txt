The Most Overlooked Marketing Tool on Medium

Medium responses can drive more relevant traffic than Quora, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook combined

Most successful writers will tell you to stay away from your stats. And that is true. You shouldn’t obsess over metrics. But we all do obsess over it — even those who tell you not to look at your stat pages (they’re probably the worst).

Stats are somewhat of recognition of your work. The answers to how many eyes have seen your message and how many people agree are in the stats. Stats are essential. But you shouldn’t look at them frantically every 7 minutes.

“Nothing changed, Karen, get back to writing.”

Every once in a while, I open the stats page to an awesome surprise. And the same happened this morning. My views exploded. The stats marked a seven-fold increase compared to a regular day. And I was confused, as I couldn’t see a single over-performing article. It took me another minute to figure out what’s going on.

Comments. The answer was in the bloody comments. Another Medium comment exploded in views, and thousands of eyes read my 120-word response. (The words “comment” and “response” are used interchangeably in this article.)

The whole scene was underwhelming, to say the least. Responses drove most of my traffic that day, and you can’t put that traffic behind a paywall.

Your responses also count to your total views on Medium. I can’t change this on my Apple devices. You could potentially open up each article and count the views you got today, and figure out what’s really going on. Still, if you have hundreds of published stories, you might decide there is a better use for your time.
