The Disfigured/ Stroke

A Poem

Wanted to find

the movement that took us

back

to the pedestal

Stinging the art

by way of making faces

& standing trying to figure

out

left & right/ There were hours

left out in the snow

they dripped with the dire

predictions

of another apocalypse but

weâ€™d just said farewell to the last

one

The birds drag slow

wings

back into the Northern Hemisphere

We

leave the tropics to themselves

while the lake

begins to soften just\ a bit
