Don’t tell me we’re alike.

You’re artful, I’m artless.

We’re both just sitting on

the same bench called art

and that’s the sole connection.

When you smile…

You lift corners of your mouth.

You strive to open it at times

showing teeth if that’s required.

Yet the face muscles stiffen

even more if that’s possible

and your eyes stay unaltered –

cold, still, lifeless.

When I smile…

I’ve no idea what I do

with my mouth or eyes.

All I know is the joy that

springs straight from my guts

to light up my face and all around

with a warm, golden sunshine.

When you move…

You’re a puppet jumping

on so many strings attached –

your tricks, deceits and lies.

There’s no temple you wouldn’t

trespass and vandalize

if it became a part of

your mischievous plan.

When I move…

I turn into a bird flying

the melody of her heart.

I soar to the sun and roll

in clouds when I feel fine.

I wrestle with the wind

and dance with the rain

when I feel I have to.

When you speak…

You’re so well pre-prepared.

Your words come out so lovely–

cheap polished glass beads

that create a necklace always

to serve one purpose only –

to decorate you, its creator.

When I speak…

I’m always bewildered by

what I’ve just produced.

Sometimes I give out diamonds,

other times crude, heavy bricks

as my words may praise or elevate

the beauty surrounding us or

fight the mean and ugly.

So don’t tell me we’re alike.

You’re artful, I’m artless.

We’re both just sitting on

the same bench called art

and that’s the sole connection.
