Kitties in Quarantine

Uma, Emerson, Bisou and Freyja have been working on their “isolation projects” and wanted to share them with you. What have your fur babies have been up to during quarantine?

It is week six of quarantine for the Burkhalter kitties. Uma, Emerson, Bisou and Freyja wanted to share with you how they are spending their days in isolation, and are curious how other kitties are doing during this time. Although life for them is not really so different than normal (except that Mom is not running off to teach yoga and Dad is working at home now) they have each developed some special “isolation time” projects to work on, and they wanted to share them with you and your furry babies. They’re curious how other cats are faring now that their humans are around all the time.

Freyja’s special project has been to train Daddy to slide precisely one treat at a time across the the dining room table to her. Dad has taken to this new routine with much delight, and seems to think (for some strange reason) that it was actually his idea. But the rest of us know better.

Uma has been working on her “mind-melding” skills to keep her humans pinned to the couch during nap times. Naps have been more difficult lately with the parents here, making noise and wanting to pet her all day long. But, how can we resist when she has a tummy this fluffy?
