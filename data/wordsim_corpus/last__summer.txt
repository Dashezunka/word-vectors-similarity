Last summer, I remember

watching planes leave contrails

zig-zagging across the sky.

I went out for long walks

and passed couples out jogging or walking their dogs

Children played in the park nearby.

I would sit on the patio of a rooftop restaurant

and watch the sunset with a glass of wine in hand

and laugh with friends over pizza and pasta in a candlelit room.

Last summer, I traveled

36,00 feet in the air

and watched clouds, dreaming lazily above the world.

I danced to music and watched movies

under a moonlit sky.

Now all I can do is cry over memories of last summer.
