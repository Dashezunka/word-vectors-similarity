An Honest Guide to Living in Los Angeles

Don’t let it get to your head.

Throw on a light jacket before heading out of your apartment. Head out to the farmers market to shop local produce. Hop on the 405 to beat the traffic on a way to a table read for work. Take the 134 back towards your apartment. Stop and pick up a green juice for eleven dollars at the local juice bar. Sign up for one month of barre classes online. Take your dog for a walk at the nearest dog park. Come home, and order vegan Mexican (don’t forget the side of chipotle crema). Indulge in fresh blueberries and hard kombucha for dessert.

For many, this is a typical day in Los Angeles. But this luxurious lifestyle doesn’t apply to everyone. Los Angeles is known as an enclave for actors, athletes and writers. Its landscape spans between mountains, valleys and a bustling city life. Los Angeles has everything to offer, if you’re rich. For working class folks, Los Angeles isn’t as much of a paradise.

The average cost of rent in Los Angeles is a whopping $2,345, making it one of the ten most expensive cities in the country.

There is no simple answer to surviving Los Angeles. The men and women you see happily walking dogs at the Silver Lake Reservoir, or indulging in $20 vegan patties in Santa Monica often come from places of privilege. But that is a very select crowd, and there is so much to offer for people who have worked their way up in this verified social scene. Forget talk of Raya or calling an Uber to1Oak, take the bus to free art shows. Get rides with friends to lectures at local universities. On weekends, take the Metro to Santa Monica for a beach day. Head down the street to the local craft brewery with co-workers after your shift ends.
